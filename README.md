# leetcode-1-Two-Sum

This is my first day in Github . I just AC the first problem in leetcode .
From now on ,I will use Github to record my life in leetcode .

I am good at C++ ,but not very professional in java and Python and I will use the 3 most popular languages to solve the problems ,
not only for practicing my algorithm but also for the learning different language grammars. 

I was an ACMer ,who was used to finish the input and output all by myself .
Leetcode is really different ,which supposes you to finish the function only .

I solved this problem with hash_map(STL) that only request about O(n) , but the leetcode always said Compile Error . 
Maybe they don't support STL hash_map.Then I tried O(n2) violently .
To my surprise ,AC.........They don't show the time and memory limit as well as the range of the data .
When it comes to Python ,I cannot AC by O(n2) .This system still need some improvement .
It's so confused .
Anyway , a fine OJ . I will get used to it and try my best to AC more problems

In the past few years ,I was using the CSDN blog to write some feelings and save my codes .
This is my blog address : blog.csdn.net/qdbszsj. Â Welcome for discussing .
